# movie-selector
Application that randomly chooses a movie for you, along with a mixed drink.
Our motivation for creating this project is to solve a problem. This project solves a common issue that affects a lot of us. Not being able to pick a movie because we’re bored. Our Random Movie Generator fixes that issue and provides a trailer to offer a glimpse of the movie. 

## User story

As an avid movie watcher, I want to be able to view the trailer before choosing a movie.
